## GRN_AML_Pipeline_Test
**Testing the Accuracy of SJARACNe and NetBID2 Pipeline with Data on Acute Myeloid Leukemia**

This project was completed during an internship at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida.  It was done under the mentorship of Dr. Timothy Shaw during the fall of 2021.  It involves gene regulatory networks (GRN) and data from patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).  The purpose of the project was to test the accuracy of a pipeline that utilized both SJARACNe and NetBID2 to determine the activity of certain driver genes.  These drivers are known to be important in the oncogenesis of AML.

Starting with a gene expression matrix (n=1,376), the data was randomly subsampled into three subsets, n=300 each.  This had to be done due to RAM limitations with running SJARACNe.  Each subset was run through SJARACNe with two lists of hub genes, both a transcription factor (TF) list and a signaling factor (SIG) list, to create six networks.  Each of these networks, along with the original expression matrix, was then used by NetBID2 functions to create six activity tables (n=1,376 each).  The activity data and a table stating which drivers of interest were mutated in each sample were both used to create a series of box plots.  These activity box plots had two columns that compared mutant and wild type samples using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.  Expression box plots were also created in a similar manner using the original expression matrix.  Finally, the changes in activity between wild type and mutant samples, as shown by the box plots and their Wilcoxon p-values, were compared with the literature.  Genes that are known to be oncogenes had expected higher activity with mutations, and genes that are known to be tumor suppressors had expected lower activity with mutations. This was used to determine how accurate the whole pipeline was.

This project was done using R and Bash.  Early parts were done on the command line with Ubuntu (from the start to using NetBID2) and later parts were completed using RStudio (box plot generation).  A report was written that was over 6,000 words, and an oral presentation with a slideshow was given as well.

SJARACNe and NetBID2 are available at https://github.com/jyyulab/SJARACNe and https://github.com/jyyulab/NetBID, respectively.
